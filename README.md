# misura

```python
>>> from misura.quantities import quantity
>>> quantity(7, "m", 1.5) / quantity(2, "s")
3.5 Â± 0.75 m / s

>>> from misura.currencies import currency
>>> currency(2, "EUR") + currency(3, "USD")
5.17 USD
```

Python library providing effortless unit handling and currency conversion for scientific and engineering purposes.

**misura** is a powerful Python library designed to facilitate the efficient handling of units of measure for scientific and engineering applications, including currencies handling and conversion with constantly updated exchange rates. With its unified interface for dealing with different units and their conversions, you can quickly and accurately complete calculations without the need for complex manual conversions. Additionally, **misura** supports uncertainty handling allowing you to work with physical quantities and their associated uncertainties in a user-friendly and intuitive fashion. What's more, **misura** grants you the flexibility to create custom units of measure, so you can work in your preferred units.
